const TEST_DATA_TEXT = "In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most " +
	"two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. A recursive definition using just " +
	"set theory notions is that a (non-empty) binary tree is a tuple (L, S, R), where L and R are binary trees or " +
	"the empty set and S is a singleton set.[1] Some authors allow the binary tree to be the empty set as well.[2]" +
	"From a graph theory perspective, binary (and K-ary) trees as defined here are actually arborescences.[3] A binary " +
	"tree may thus be also called a bifurcating arborescence[3]â€”a term which appears in some very old programming " +
	"books,[4] before the modern computer science terminology prevailed. It is also possible to interpret a binary " +
	"tree as an undirected, rather than a directed graph, in which case a binary tree is an ordered, rooted tree.[5] " +
	"Some authors use rooted binary tree instead of binary tree to emphasize the fact that the tree is rooted, but as " +
	"defined above, a binary tree is always rooted.[6] A binary tree is a special case of an ordered K-ary tree, " +
	"where k is 2.In mathematics, what is termed binary tree can vary significantly from author to author. " +
	"Some use the definition commonly used in computer science,[7] but others define it as every non-leaf having " +
	"exactly two children and don't necessarily order (as left/right) the children either.[8]In computing, binary " +
	"trees are used in two very different ways"
